# egressd

Kubernetes aware network traffic monitoring.

### How it works

* DaemonSet pod starts on each node.
* Conntrack entries are fetched for pods running on each at configured interval (5 seconds by default).
  * If Cilium is used then conntrack records are fetched from eBPF maps located at host /sys/fs/bpf. These maps are created by Cilium.
  * If Linux Netfilter Conntrack module is used then Netlink is used to get these records.
* Records are reduced by source IP, destination, IP and protocol.
* Kubernetes context is added including source and destination pods, nodes, node zones, ips.
* Exporter can export logs to http or prometheus.

#### Privileges

Egressd runs as privileged container for a few reasons:
1. DNS tracer uses eBPF.
2. Fetch conntrack entries:
    * Bidirectional mount propogation is used to enable netfilter conntrack accounting and mount cgroupv2.
    * If Cilium is used collector reads from ebpf maps which stores data in kernel.

### Install

**Install demo with preconfigured grafana and prometheus metrics.**
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/castai/egressd/master/demo.sh | bash
```

**Expose grafana locally**
```sh
 kubectl port-forward svc/egressd-grafana 8080:80 -n egressd
```
Example dashboard available at http://localhost:8080/d/egressd/egressd
Metrics should be visible after few minutes.

**(Optionally) Install demo onlineboutique eshop**

If you want to test egressd on empty cluster.
```sh
helm upgrade --install onlineboutique oci://us-docker.pkg.dev/online-boutique-ci/charts/onlineboutique -n demo --create-namespace
```

### Development

Start all components + test grafana,prometheus in tilt local k8s cluster.
```
tilt up
```
